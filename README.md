### Objectives
*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

- Implement advanced jQuery events.
- Use event delegation to manage dynamic content.
- Use implicit iteration to update elements of a jQuery. selection and chaining to place methods on selectors.
- Add a templating language to our projects for better and more abstracted content manipulation.

### Preparation
*Before this lesson, students should already be able to:*

- Register and trigger event handles for jQuery click event.
- Manipulate the DOM by using jQuery selectors and functions.

> Note: Last class, we learned how to manipulate the DOM using jQuery selectors! Check with students to make sure that everyone is comfortable with the materials covered in the last class.

## Events Continued (15 minutes)
Last lesson we learned what the DOM was and how to manipulate it with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery. We got a taste of jQuery's power in making our interaction with the DOM significantly easier. Although we covered the basics of using jQuery, such as selecting DOM elements, adding content, and listening for a basic click event, we need to understand jQuery events and DOM manipulation more intimately for true dynamic applications. In this lesson we will work with additional jQuery events and understand implications of adding dynamic content to our pages. We will also work with a templating engine for better separation of concerns in our code.

We were able to implement a click event in the last lesson, however jQuery [and JavaScript] gives us the ability to listen to a plethora of additional user events. Additionally, what if we have multiple events for specific elements? What if we want to listen for events to elements that have not yet been added to our interface?

We can listen for mouse, keyboard, form, and document/window events. Today we will focus on mouse events, however listening to other events is very similar to mouse events.

*Mouse Events:*
- click
- dblclick
- mouseenter
- mouseleave

*Keyboard Events*
- keypress
- keydown
- keyup

*Form Events*
- submit
- change
- focus
- blur

*Document/Window Events*
- load
- resize
- scroll
- unload

## Event Delegation and Best Practices: Codealong (30 min)
We started covering mouse events with the click event. We can add additional mouse events in the same manner.

```js
  var $thingListItems = $('#fav-list li');

  $thingListItems.on('mouseenter', function(e) {
    $(this).removeClass('inactive');
    $(this).siblings().addClass('inactive');
  });

  $thingListItems.on('mouseleave', function(e) {
    $(this).siblings().removeClass('inactive');
  });
```
The above code listens for two events:

1. User's mouse set to enter the list item element. In this case, it removes the 'inactive' class from itself (if it exists) and adds it to its sibling list items. *Note: element and sibling class switching is a common best practice to toggle visual effects on user actions.*
2. User's mouse set to leave the list item element. This removes the 'inactive' class from all elements on the same level.

While the above code works great for existing elements, if we add new elements to the DOM, the events will not fire up for the newly added elements.

It is important to understand that these direct events are only attached to elements at the time that the 'on' method is called. If list items did not exist when the above events were called, they do not get included in the calls above.

To get around this, we create a delegated event, which requires us to add the element our event handler executes for, to the right side. Take the above code and modify to:

```js
  var $thingList = $('#fav-list');

  $thingList.on('mouseenter', 'li', function(e) {
    $(this).removeClass('inactive');
    $(this).siblings().addClass('inactive');
  });

  $thingList.on('mouseleave', 'li', function(e) {
    $(this).siblings().removeClass('inactive');
  });
```

Our code is getting a little inefficient and duplicative. Our list items have two event handles attached to them. We can handle both of the above scenarios with one event handler. Grouping our events by element not only helps us group our code, but it is also a drastically faster operation.

```js
  var $thingList = $('#fav-list');

  $thingList.on('mouseenter mouseleave', 'li', function(event) {
       if (event.type == 'mouseenter') {
         $(this).removeClass('inactive');
         $(this).siblings().addClass('inactive');
      } else if (event.type == 'mouseleave') {
          $(this).siblings().removeClass('inactive');
      }
  });
```

Let's add a dash in front of every one of our list items (yes in addition to the bullets). jQuery gives us a convenience method to iterate through a list of elements.

```js
  var $thingList = $('#fav-list');

  $thingList.find('li').each(function() {
    $(this).prepend(' - ');
  });
```

## Appending: Independent Practice (30 mintutes)

Open [the starter code](starter-code/event_delegation) and refactor it as follows: use event delegation so that you only have to set one event listener for all the items once - when the code first runs - and you don't have to add any others whenever someone adds an item.

**Bonus**:

- When the user mouses over each item, the item should turn grey. Don't use CSS hovering for this
- Add another link, after each item, that allows you to delete the item

## Separation of Concerns and Templating: Introduction (25 minutes)

Through event handlers and DOM manipulation we are able to making our applications more dynamic, interactive, responsive, and just plain fun. However, even with a small to do list app, our code is starting to grow significantly. If we keep stacking features, our code will soon become much more difficult to manage. We are currently having to interact with our data as DOM elements. As our applications start forming relationships, it will become very messy to get values, serialize them, and pass them around.

This is why separating our data from our view logic becomes very important. We can still use jQuery to interact with the DOM and listen for user events, however our business rules (data) should be kept separate from the view. This is where templating becomes very useful.

Templating lets us reference a snippet of code, and populate it with data we store in actual JavaScript objects, before adding it to the DOM. There are many JavaScript templating libraries like [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/), and [Underscore templates](http://underscorejs.org/). Today we will be working with [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/).

## Templating: Codealong (35 minutes)
Handlebars has a 4 step process to implementing templates in our applications:

  1. Create the template(s)
  2. Reference and compile template
  3. Pass the object to compile to Handlebars
  4. Add the new compiled element to DOM


1. We create our element surrounded in script tags with a reference id and a type of handlebars template. We surround the content that's to be replaced by double curly brackets.

  ```html
    <script id="hello-world-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
      <h1>{{helloTitle}}</h1>
      <p>{{helloContent}}</p>
    </script>
  ```

2. We can then use jQuery to reference the newly created template and pass that reference to Handlebars.

  ```js
    var source = $('#hello-world-template').html();
    var template = Handlebars.compile(source);
  ```

3. We can then pass our data object to the newly created template.

4. And add it to the DOM via jQuery.

  ```js
    var source = $('#hello-world-template').html();
    var template = Handlebars.compile(source);

    var helloStatement = { helloTitle: "Hello world", helloContent: "GA JS class is just awesome"};

    var compiledTemplate = template(helloStatement);
    $('body').append(compiledTemplate);

    // or you could have done $('body').append(template(helloStatement));
  ```

This routine allows us to organize our code by DOM and event logic (usually taken care of by jQuery in our case) and by model logic (currently just JS models). This will help interacting with data sets much cleaner and more manageable.

## To Do List: Independent Practice (35 minutes)

Build on top of the to-do list app to store your initial to-do data in a JavaScript object and interact with the object whenever the user interacts with the DOM.

1. Use Handlebars to add any new DOM content.

2. Store all of your data in a todos object.

3. Organize your code so your app logic is DRY.

4. Bonus: create a method you can reference in your app to compile your data to Handlebars templates, instead of relying on doing this every time you need to add a DOM object.

## Conclusion (5 min)

Ask students what was learned. Make sure the objectives have been met.
* Why would we want to use templating?
* What is event delegation? Why would we use it?
